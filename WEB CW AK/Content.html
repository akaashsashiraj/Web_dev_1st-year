            <h1>Adapting to Climate Change</h1>
            <p>Global economy, people, and ecosystems are facing previously unheard-of difficulties as a result of climate change.
                In order to reduce the effects of climate change and increase resilience, adaptation is crucial as temperatures
                rise and weather patterns become more erratic. Here, we look at ways to promote a sustainable future while adjusting 
                to the changing climatic reality.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Climate Resilience</h2>
                    <p>The ability of people, communities, and systems to foresee, plan for, and adapt to the effects of climate change
                    is referred to as climate resilience. Reducing exposure to risks associated with climate change and improving
                    adaptive capability are two aspects of building resilience. These policies cover a wide range of industries,
                    including public health, infrastructure, agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity preservation.</p>
